This distribution of nachos contains all of the original nachos code, wrapped
in a default eclipse workbench that includes Run Configurations for
running tests with JUnit.

Simply point eclipse at the root of this repo as your workbench directory, and
select one of the JUnit Run Configurations that have been set up for each
project.

Run -> Run Configurations -> JUnit

Some default JUnit tests have been set up for you, but you should add
your own tests throughout the course of each project.
